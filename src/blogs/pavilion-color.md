It has been a while since my last post, the longest amount of time I have ever taken away from this website actually. As much as I love illustrating architecture, I love doing other things too and sometimes there isn’t enough time to do both. Besides working digitally, I spend quite a bit of time building and doing carpentry work on my house. I use to work in the wood shop when I was at grad school at Miami University and I have carried over those skills into revitalizing our historic 1920’s Dutch colonial house. Anyways, it was getting to the point where the time spent working on the computer vs working with my hands and doing physical work was getting a little too out of balance.

With that said, I still thought a lot about the Summerfest Pavilion and the images I was creating. As soon as I got back into things, I started to rework the design…..again. I can’t seem to get to a place where I am satisfied with how the architecture is articulated. The overall roof form has not changed but how it meets the ground has. The building was feeling too solid so I removed some walls and added columns.

The two images in this post below perhaps represent a more aggressive approach that I am taking on things such as color grading. I played around with increased color saturation, slightly unnatural toning, highly textured sky’s, etc. The illustrations took on a sort of vintage vibe but I like the look and plan to continue exploring some of these ideas in future images. Below is a super quick break down.
